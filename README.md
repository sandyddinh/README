## Concept:

A game inspired by the classic *Family Fued*. In *2020 in Rewind* two teams compete to guess the most popular answer based on surveys (note, unfortunely there were no actual surveys completed). The team with the highest number of points after 3 rounds will be declared the winners.

## Technologies Used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript 
* External JavaScript Library

## Approach:

#### Overview
I started off by writing all of the rules and combinations for a traditional game of *Family Feud*. After evaluating all of the rules and time constraint, I decided to shift my idea to an original game, inspired by *Family Feud* - alas, *2020 in Rewind* came to fruition. I drew my wireframes with the colours blue, yellow, and orange in mind. Upon reflecting on my game, and 2020, I decided I wanted a relaxing and happy UX so I chose a beautiful cloud background, used clean lines, and subtle styling.

#### Development Plan 

The development plan was to start off with very basic HTML, no CSS, and a lot of JavaScript. Once most of the functionality was in place and working with the console, I focused on populating the DOM and HTML and CSS for visual effects.

* Develop the Team object and minimum functions required to compare an input to a list of answers.
* Develop functions to keep track of points, strikes, answers, who's turn it is, etc.
* Develop rest of functions (like stealing the points) to support the rules.
* Populate the DOM with all game information.
* Style the game!

#### MVP

#### Stretch goals
